They were unable to conclude why this retrograde motion is happening later, in the 15th century Copernicus\ngave a convincing Helios centric model to explain the retrograde motion. \n\nIf you stand up above the celestial North Pole you will see that Earth and all other planets will be moving from west to east and this is called Pro-grade motion or a forward motion\nbut sometimes some planets will appear to move from east to west which is called retrograde motion. With respect to other planet, the person in the earth will see an illusion such that the other planet will look\nlike moving from east to west. This illusionary backward motion is called retrograde motion. \n\nThe retrograde motion can be best understood by observing how the car overtakes on the road. For example, if you are traveling in a car in lane 2 and if you are trying to overtake\nan another car which is traveling in lane 1. After you overtake If you look back the other car out of your window it may look like moving backward, although both the cars are also moving forward.\nIt is the illusion because of relative motion of two cars. This is what exactly happening in retrograde motion also due to the relative motion of Earth with respect to other planet the other planet may look like moving backward.\n\n1. The Rahu will always be in retrograde motion\n2. The Ketu will always be in retrograde motion\n3. Sun will never be in retrograde motion\n4. Moon will never be in retrograde motion\n5. Jupiter will have retrogration for some period of time\n6. Mars will have retrogration for some period of time\n7. Mercury will have retrogration for some period of time\n8. Venus will have retrogration for some period of time\n9.
