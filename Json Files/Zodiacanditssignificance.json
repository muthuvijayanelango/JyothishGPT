But with the help of Zodiac, we can easily locate the objects in the space easily.\nThe Zodiac is an area of the sky that extends approximately 8 to 9 degrees north or south of the ecliptic. The apparent part of Sun Moon all visible planets from the Earth are within the belt of Zodiac.\nHence the Zodiac is the best reference frame to locate planets and stars in the space. \n\nThese are some of the important qualities of the zodiac that made it to be the best fit of reference\n\n1. The size and the distance of the reference frame should be very high. The Zodiac is so big that the size of our solar system is negligible when compared to the size of the zodiac.\n2. The plane of the reference should be same as that of ecliptic. Although the zodiac is 8 to 9 degrees north or south of the ecliptic, compared to the size and distance of the zodiac 8 or 9 degree is negligible\n3. The Earth centric view should cover our entire view through this framework. The Zodiac as reference frame will cover our entire view within the frame. Anyone from any part of the earth will be able to view \nthe position of stars and planet in the same point.
