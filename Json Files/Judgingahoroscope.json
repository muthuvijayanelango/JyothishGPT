One must use common sense coupled with certain amount of intuition. An astrologer cannot make good judgment just by going through the Vedic text and one must practice using ample example charts.\nAn astrologer should have a strong skills in astronomy, Data analysis, history, current affairs, and good philosophical knowledge to make accurate and relavent predictions. In summary a good astrologer should have the right mix of profound knowledge, concise judgment, and immense power of intuition. \n\nImportant rules for making predictions(judgement) from a horoscope\n1. Understanding strength of the horoscope is very important and without which you may potentially give the wrong judgment.\n2. The trine houses(ie; First house, fifth house and ninth house) are the foundations of the horoscope. In any horoscope, If the trine houses are well placed then we can confidently say the foundation of the horoscope is strong.\n3. The kendra house(ie; first house, fourth house, seventh house and tenth house) are like pillars of the horoscope. The strong lagna lord is must to operate to the full potential of the horoscope.\nEven if the horoscope has too many Raja yoga, But if the lagna lord is not strong then the native will not able to manifest the full results of the Raja yogas.\n4. The Dusthana houses(ie; the sixth house, eighth house and twelfth house) should be free from the afflictions.\n5. Any Bhavathipathi aspecting it's own bhava adds strength to the bhava. For example, the lagnalord aspecting lagna will add strength to the lagna and the second lord aspecting second house will add strength the second Bhava and so on and so forth.\n6. Even if a bhava(or a house) is afflicted the aspection of Jupiter is capable of decreasing the afflictions.
