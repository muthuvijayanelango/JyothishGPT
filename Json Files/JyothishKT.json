For example, Isaac Newton who introduced the gravitational force to the modern world, Kepler\nwho developed the law of planetary motion and Galileo who found the satellites of Jupiter and Saturn rings and all of them had a knowledge in astrology.\nThe Surya Siddhanta, one of the oldest book on astronomy known to mankind has been written in India and contributed by many of the Indian astronomers like Varahamihra, Bhaskaracharya.\nSage Varahamihra is known for this wonderful work on Brihat Samhita which talks about planetary motions and its influences on countries. The Bhaskaracharya is also a prominent Indian astronomer and in fact he noted gravitational\nforce well before Newton in his treasure Surya Siddhanta. \n\nLet me quickly take you through the commonalities and differences between astrology and astronomy.\n1. The astronomy is the study of celestial objects such as planets, moons, and stars whereas the astrology is the study of planetary influence on human life. \n2.The astronomy is more of observational study and it is primarily focused on studying origin and the evolution of human mankind whereas the astrology is a predictive and guiding tool to mankind \n3. Before 1400 AD astronomy and astrology were studied together but after 1400 to 1700 AD astronomy gained interest among many researchers and because of that the astronomy became part of science whereas the astrology remained\nmystics science till today.\n\nThe Surya Siddhanta, the oldest text of astronomy was written between 500 to 600 A.D. This timeline is approximate because there are several studies still going out to find when exactly the Surya Siddhanta has been written. \nThe Vedic period is believed to between 1200 to 1500 BCE. The modern astronomy evolved after 400 AD. People like Bhaskara, Aryabhata, Kepler.

In fact, you have to travel very far to physically see the entire solar system.\nWhen we observe and understand the entire solar system from here we need to have a good imagination skill\nFirst let us understand what is ecliptic and ecliptic plane. The Sun is at the center of our solar system.\nThe Earth revolves around the Sun and the Moon revolves around the Earth.\nThe path in which the Earth revolves around the sun is called the ecliptic and all other planet is also revolving around the sun in the ecliptic plane.\nThe other planets in the solar system such as Mercury, Venus, Mars, Jupiter, and Saturn are revolving around the sun is called ecliptic plane.\nNow let us understand how we observe the planets and stars in our solar system from the earth.\nTo observe all the planets from Earth, we are drawing an imaginary sphere with a huge diameter and this is called celestial sphere.\nThe Celestial Sphere is so huge it can envelop all the planets inside our solar system. Please remember that the celestial sphere is a imaginary sphere. \nThe center line of the earth is called equator and as we project this line in the celestial sphere we get the celestial equator and meets at the North Pole of Earth.\nThe otherside is the South Pole of Earth and as we project this north and south pole we get north celestial pole and south celestial pole. \nAs I mentioned before, the Earth revolves around the sun in ecliptic.\nYou remember right? when we view from here.\nWhen viewed from the Earth the Sun travels in the ecliptic path. The Earth is tilted 23.5 degrees and because of this tilt the celestial equator\nand the ecliptic are off by 23.5 degrees.\nNow to locate any object in the Earth we need at least two coordinates.\nFor example if someone asked me where I am currently located I would give them at least two coordinates since I am currently located in Coimbatore, India.\nI would tell them I am located approximately at 11 degree north & 77 degrees east. so anyone living in any part of the world will be able to locate my place with this coordinates.\nSimilarly to locate any object in the space we need at least two coordinates and to locate any object in the space we used to coordinates called right accession and declination.\nBefore going to right accession and let me tell you what is vernal equinox.\nThe path of the ecliptic and celestial equator intersects at two points and these two points are called vernal equinox and autumnal equinox. Since the tilt of Earth\nat Equinox point is zero the day and night will be equal at this point.\nThe vernal equinox falls on March 21st in which the day and night are equal and the autumnal equinox falls on September 23 in which the again the day and night are equal. \nNow the right accession is the radial distance from Vernal Equinox to the edge of the celestial sphere.\nThe Earth takes 24 hours to complete self-revolution, so the time taken for any object to come to the same position in celestial equator is 24 hours\nThe right accession calculated in the eastern side will be positive and in the western side will be negative.\nThe declension at equinox point is. The sun will have a maximum of 23.5 degrees north declination which is called Summer Solstice.\nWhen sun reached maximum declination of 23.5 south is called Winter Solstice.\nCan you guess the declination of north celestial pole? Yes, It is +90 degree.\n", "doc_id": "e5b52e6f-2a3a-400a-871b-51b6700bdf09", "embedding": null, "extra_info": null, "index": 0, "child_indices": [], "ref_doc_id": "9c0d455c-2a50-4501-ad0e-0672759c3b3a", "node_info": {"start": 0, "end": 3639}}, {"text": "We are see the timing of events in Vedic astrology.

One must use common sense coupled with certain amount of intuition. An astrologer cannot make good judgment just by going through the Vedic text and one must practice using ample example charts.\nAn astrologer should have a strong skills in astronomy, Data analysis, history, current affairs, and good philosophical knowledge to make accurate and relavent predictions. In summary a good astrologer should have the right mix of profound knowledge, concise judgment, and immense power of intuition. \n\nImportant rules for making predictions(judgement) from a horoscope\n1. Understanding strength of the horoscope is very important and without which you may potentially give the wrong judgment.\n2. The trine houses(ie; First house, fifth house and ninth house) are the foundations of the horoscope. In any horoscope, If the trine houses are well placed then we can confidently say the foundation of the horoscope is strong.\n3. The kendra house(ie; first house, fourth house, seventh house and tenth house) are like pillars of the horoscope.

The Dusthana houses(ie; the sixth house, eighth house and twelfth house) should be free from the afflictions.\n5. Any Bhavathipathi aspecting it's own bhava adds strength to the bhava.

The Sun and Moon rules only one sign each. Sun rules Leo and Moon rules Cancer.\nThe sign Gemini and Virgo are ruled by Mercury. The sign Taurus and Libra are ruled by Venus. The sign Aries and Scorpio are ruled by Mars. The sign Pisces and Sagittarius are ruled by Jupiter. \nThe sign Aquarius and Capricorn are ruled by Saturn. \n\nNow, I am going to explain the Exaltation, debilitation and Moolatrikona signs for each planet here.\n\nThe exaltation literally means the planets when occupies these signs gets high dignity. \n\nLets go over exaltation signs. \n1. The Sun gets exalted in the sign Aries and Sun gets deep exaltation at 10 degree of Aries.\n2. The Moon gets exalted in the sign Taurus and exactly at 3 degrees it is in the deep exaltation.\n3. Mercury gets exaltation in the sign Virgo and mercury gets deep exaltation at 15th degree.\n4. Mars gets exalted in the sign Capricorn. At 28th degrees Mars gets deep exaltation\n5. Jupiter gets exaltation in the sign of cancer and at 5 degrees Jupiter gets deep exaltation\n6. Saturn gets exalted on the sign Libra and at 20 degree Saturn gets deep exaltation\n7. Venus gets exalted on the sign Pisces and at 27th degree Venus gets deep exaltation.\n\nThe Debilitation means weakness, so when Planet occupy these signs then it becomes weak. Here is the easy way to remember the debilitation sign. The debilitation sign is very easy to remember if you are aware of the exaltation signs the debilitation sign of a planet will be exactly 180 degree from its exaltation point for all the zodiac signs diagonally opposite side is 180 degree. \nFor example for the Aries the Libra is 180 degree and for Taurus Scorpio is 180 degree and for Gemini Sagittarius is 180 degree and for cancer the Capricorn is 180 degree and for Leo Aquarius is 180 degree so on and so forth.\n\nThe following are debilitation sign for each planets\n1. Sun gets debilitated in the sign Libra at 10 degrees  \n2. Moon gets debilitated in 3 degrees Scorpio\n3. Mercury gets debilitated in 15 degrees Pisces\n4. Venus gets debilitated at 27 degrees Virgo \n5. Mars get debilitated in the sign Cancer at 28 degrees\n6. Jupiter gets debilitated at 5 degrees Capricorn \n7. Saturn gets debilitated at 20 degree Aries\n\nAnother easy way to remember the debilitation signs of each planets is, the signs in which Sun gets exalted that the Saturn will get debilitated. Similarly, the sign in which Saturn gets exalted that the sun will get debilitated\nThe sign in which Mercury gets exalted Venus will get debilitated. The sign in which Venus gets exalted that the mercury will become debilitated the sign in which Mars gets exalted. The Mars will be debilitated in the sign in which Jupiter gets exalted and Mars will be debilitated in the sign where Jupiter gets exalted and finally the moon alone will get debilitated in Scorpio.\n\nThe Moolatrikona sign is again the benefic sign, When the planet occupies Moolatrikona signs its dignity is again high. Hence a planet in the Moolatrikona is capable of producing good results. \n\nThe following are Moolatrikona sign for each planets\n1. Sun gets Moolatrikona in the sign Leo between 0 to 20 degrees\n2. Moon gets Moolatrikona in the Sign Taurus within 4 to 20 degrees\n3. Mercury gets Moolatrikona on the sign Virgo between 16 to 20 degrees\n4. Venus gets Moolatrikona in the sign Libra between 0 to 15 degrees\n5. Mars gets Moolatrikona in the sign Aries is between 0 to 12 degrees\n6. Jupiter gets Moolatrikona in the sign Sagittarius between zero to 10 degrees\n7. Saturn gets Moolatrikona in the sign Aquarius between 0 to 20 degrees\n\nA quick thumb rule to remember Moolatrikona house for all planets except Mercury and moon the Moolatrikona house will be own sign of the planet. For example the sun gets Moolatrikona in the sign Leo\nwhich is its own house. The Venus gets Moolatrikona in the sign Libra which is its own house. Mars gets Moolatrikona in the sign Aries which is its own house and Jupiter gets Moolatrikona in the sign\nSagittarius which is its own house and Saturn gets Moolatrikona the sign Aquarius which is its own house and for the moon The Moolatrikona house will be exalted house. \nFor Mercury Moolatrikona house is both exalted and own house. \n", "doc_id": "8d691bea-3f7d-4e86-abba-825b0287e948", "embedding": null, "extra_info": null, "index": 0, "child_indices": [], "ref_doc_id": "6d3bcd73-30d8-4257-ad8b-a7013db8f313", "node_info": {"start": 0, "end": 5518}}, {"text": "When two or more planets are conjoined in the same zodiac sign it is called as planetary conjunction. \nThe result of the conjunction depends on the nature of the planets involved and also depends\non the zodiac sign in which the conjunction occurs.

This is caused by the cyclic precession of the earth\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s axis in its rotation.  \nThe Earth has a wobbling motion and one wobbling cycle of Earth approximately takes 26000 years. This wobbling effect of Earth creates precession of equinox. Spin top is the best example to understand the Earth's wobble effect. \nThe Earth has bulge at the centre and the Earth will have a more gravitational pull from both sun and moon in this middle area. \nAnd because of more gravitational pull at the centre of the Earth, there is a shift of axis in the north and south pole is called wobble effect.\nThe intersection of ecliptic plane and celestial equator is called vernal equinox. This vernal equinox is moving one degree for every 72 years due Earth's wobble effect.\nIn one AD the North Pole is pointing towards the sign Pisces and the north pole star is Polaris.The pole star is changing for every 2000 years and this cycle completes in twenty six thousand years.\nIf you look up the night sky and observe north celestial pole, the north pole star will shift for every 2000 years.

The Moon illuminates light from the sun and when Earth comes between the Sun and the Moon the Earth's shadow completely covers the Moon thus creating lunar\neclipse. When the Moon comes between the Earth and the Sun, it will block the light of Sun coming to the Earth and thus creating Solar Eclipse. \nYou may think Moon is relatively smaller than the Sun but how would Moon completely cover the sunlight coming to the earth. But interestingly if you take the distance between the Earth and Moon as one, the distance between the Earth\none and Sun is 400 times distant from the Earth. Also, the size of the sun is also 400 times greater than the moon. Because of this reason when viewed from the earth both Moon and Sun looks to be of same size. This is why during Solar Eclipse Moon is able to completely block the Sun light.\nWhy eclipse is not occurring for every 15 days, during full moon or new moon day? The moon's orbit around the Earth and the Earth's orbit around the Sun are tilted approximately 5 degrees. When the Moon orbits the Earth in the same ecliptic plane of that of Sun then ideally we would have eclipse for every 15 days\nBecause of the difference between the ecliptic plane(Earth's path around the Sun) and Moon's orbit, the eclipse is possible only when Earth, Sun, and Moon are aligned in the line of nodes. \nIf you draw an imaginary lines along the line of nodes, the north node is called Rahu and the South node is called Ketu. \nSince Rahu & Ketu are always in the line of nodes, Rahu and Ketu play a vital role in the formation of Eclipse.\nYou can easily find the eclipse date and time by casting a vedic chart. In a vedic chart, when Sun, Moon, Rahu and Ketu aligns in the same line of nodes the eclipse will occur.

The Chandra Mangala yoga is formed when the Mars conjoins the Moon. The eminent astrologer Dr. B.V. Raman notes that Chandra Mangala yoga is formed even when Mars and Moon are Kendra from each other.\nChandra Mangala yoga is capable of giving financial success and success in business ventures. Since Moon is the karaka for liquids, This Yoga is very special for success in business related to liquids.\n\n3. The Adhi yoga is formed when the benefics are situated in sixth, seventh and eighth house from the Moon. Adhi Yoga makes a person polite, trustworthy, happy, healthy, and livelong.\n\n4. The Vasumathi yoga is formed when the benefics occupies Upachaya houses(3rd, 6th, 10th and 11th house) either from Lagna or from Moon. The Vasumathi yoga is capable of giving plenty of wealth.\n\n5. The Sakata yoga is an Arishta yoga which means this is capable of giving misfortunes. When Moon is the sixth, eighth, and twelfth from Jupiter then Sakata yoga is raised. Sakata yoga will give lot of\nfinancial ups and downs to the native and Sakata yoga will also give a lot of obstructions in life.\n\n6. The Amala yoga is formed when the tenth house from Lagna or Moon is occupied by benefic. The benefic here are Jupiter, Mercur,y Venus, Waxing Moon.

Lakshmi Yoga makes the native learned, wealthy, noble and\nthe enjoy all the pleasures and comforts of life.\n \n8. The Jaya yoga is formed when the sixth Lord is debilitated and at the same time the tenth lord is exalted. The Jaya literally means success. The sixth house represents enemies so when sixth lord become weak and at the\nsame time tenth lord becomes strong then the native is capable of winning over the enemies and get the success.\n\n9.

So these five yogas are created by five planets viz Jupiter, Venus, Mercury, Mars and Saturn.\nThe first one is Hamsa yoga. When Jupiter occupies Kendra which is his own house or exaltation house then Hamsa yoga is formed. Hamsa yoga will give handsome appearance, pure in mind and rightous.\nThe second is Malavya Yoga. For Malavya yoga, the Venus should be in kendra which should be his own house or exaltation house. The Venus is the planet of material success, So the Malavya yoga will give wealth,\nA lot of command over the vehicles and give happy married life.\nThe third is Sasa yoga. For Sasa yoga, the Saturn should occupy Kendra which is own house or exaltation house of Saturn. The native with Sasa yoga will have\nlot of good servants and he will be the head of the big organization.\nThe fourth is the Ruchaka yoga.

Mars is the planet of Defense and Army.\nSo Ruchaka yoga will give rise to leader of army or a head of big institution and the native with Ruchaka yoga will be a commanding leader.\nThe fifth is Bhadra yoga. For Bhadraa Yoga, Mercury should be in the kendra which should be his own house or exaltation house. The mercury is the planet of intellect,\nso the native with Bhadra yoga will be highly intellect, learned, wealthy, and successful.\n\nThe most important point to be noted here is the Lagna lord should be strong in the horoscope to see the maximum benefit of any of these Yogas. \nWhen Lagna lord becomes weak in the horoscope then the yogas presented here will work only to the limited extent.

They were unable to conclude why this retrograde motion is happening later, in the 15th century Copernicus\ngave a convincing Helios centric model to explain the retrograde motion. \n\nIf you stand up above the celestial North Pole you will see that Earth and all other planets will be moving from west to east and this is called Pro-grade motion or a forward motion\nbut sometimes some planets will appear to move from east to west which is called retrograde motion. With respect to other planet, the person in the earth will see an illusion such that the other planet will look\nlike moving from east to west. This illusionary backward motion is called retrograde motion. \n\nThe retrograde motion can be best understood by observing how the car overtakes on the road. For example, if you are traveling in a car in lane 2 and if you are trying to overtake\nan another car which is traveling in lane 1. After you overtake If you look back the other car out of your window it may look like moving backward, although both the cars are also moving forward.\nIt is the illusion because of relative motion of two cars.

Planets on account of certain positions in the heaven gets certain source of strength and weakness.\nSimilarly, Bhavas(houses) on account of being occupied or aspected by certain planets will acquire certain source of strength and weakness, \nthis calculation of strength of planets and Bhavas is purely astronomical. Usually this value of strength of Bhavas and planets will be in the mathematical Number.\nThis mathematical value will be immensely helpful while making predictions of the horoscopes.\n\nThe planetary strength is collectively called the Shadbala. The shad literally means six and balas literally means strength. So the Shadbala is \nis the six source of planetary strength.\n\nLet us go over each strength.\n1. The first one is Sthanabala, Sthana means position. The Sthanabala is the positional strength of the planet due to the planet occupying certain positions in the horoscope. \nThe Sthanabala is the cumulative of Ochchabala, Saptavargaja bala, Ojayngmarasyamsa bala, kendrabala and drekkanabala.\n\n2.The second is Digbala. Dig literally means direction. The digbala is the calculation of strength according to the planetary directions in the horoscope.\nThe Jupiter and mercury Gets highest Digbala when occupies ascendant(East). The Moon and Venus gets maximum dig bala when occupies fourth house(South).\nThe Saturn gets the highest Digbala in the seventh house(West). The sun and mars gets the highest digbala in the tenth house(North).\n\n3. The third is Chestabala. The Chesta literally means motion and Bala indicate strength. Chesta Bala is acquired by a planet due to motion. Especially retrograde motion\nMars, Mercury, Jupiter, Saturn and Venus gets Chestabala during retrograde motion or in conjunction with full moon.\n\n4. The fourth is Kalabala. The Kala means time and bala means strength. The Kalabala is calculated by considering the year, month, date, and time of the birth. Since that time is continually\nchanging this Kalabala is also the refered as temporal strength. The Kalabala is cumulative of Nathonnatha bala, Paksha bala, Thribhaga bala, Varsadhipa bala, Masa bala, Vara bala, Hora bala,\nAyana bala, and Yuddha bala. \n\n5. the fifth is Drikbala. Drik Literally means Aspection or drishti. The Drikbala of a planet is acquired by Aspection and hence it is called as Aspectional strength.\nThe general thump rule for drikbala is when the planet gets benefic aspection it will get full drikbala, whereas if the planet gets malefic aspection from other planet then\nit'll take away the strength.\n\n6. The sixth is Naisargikabala which literally means permanent strength. The kalabala which we discussed before a while is a temporal strength \nWhereas the Naisargikabala is the permanent strength. So irrespective of the horoscope, The Naisargikabala Of planet is always the same. Naisargikabala bala is mentioned in shastiamsas.\n1. Naisargikabala of Sun is 60 Shastiamsas.\n2. Naisargikabala of Moon is 51.43 Shastiamsas.\n3. Naisargikabala of Venus is 42.85 Shastiamsas.\n4. Naisargikabala of Jupiter is 34.28 Shastiamsas.\n5. Naisargikabala of Mercury is 25.70 Shastiamsas.\n6. Naisargikabala of Mars is 17.14 Shastiamsas.\n7. Naisargikabala of Saturn is 8.57 Shastiamsas.\n\nThe Residential strength is acquired by the planet according to the it Occupancy in the Bhava. A planet that is in the middle of the bhava\nWill have more residential strength whereas the planet in the bhava sandhis will have less residential Strength.\n\nThe next is Bhavabala, The Bhaba literally means house and bala is strength. Bhava Bala is the strength of house of signification. \nbhavabala is cumulative of Bhavadhi  bala, Bhava dig bala, and Bahava drishti bala. When a bhava gets more\nstrength in the horoscope than the results pertaining to that Bhava will be more pronounces whereas if a Bhava bala in a particular horoscope is weak\nthen the results pertaining to that Bhava will be less pronounced.\n\nThe next is Ishta bala and Kashta bala. The Ishta means good and Kashta means bad. So, Ishta and Kashta bala of a planet will be useful to access to good and\nbad results of planet in the dasa period with respect to the Bhava. For example in a horoscope if Jupiter occupies seventh house and gets more Ishta bala\nthen in Jupiter dasa or bukti the native will see more good results related to marriage, business partnership, and travel.

In fact karma and astrology are interrelated and Without understanding karma one cannot understand and appreciate astrology.\nKarma is the best proof to show disparities in human life. Let us get a little deeper into the theory of karma. The universe is operating in a certain harmony. When harmony is disturbed nature will always try to restore its lost harmony.\nFor example when the pendulums is at equilibrium state there will not be any motion. When we perform an action of pulling one pendulum back then the harmony is disturbed.\nNow, this first pendulum will create an in-equilibrium in all other pendulums. This in-equilibrium will continue until all the pendulums come back to an equilibrium state. \nIn a similar way The Karma neither rewards nor punishes. It only restores its lost harmony.\nKarma is commonly referred to the cycle of cause and effect but it is not as simple as this pendulum example where the last harmony will be restored quickly.\nThe karma is a circular cause and effect. The Karma is neither good nor bad. The Karma is also not an instant reward system but the karma is just the result of Pava(bad deeds) and Puniya(good deeds).\nThe man will suffer or rejoice based on his past acts. \n\nLet us see three types of Karma,\n1. Sanchita Karma\n2. Prarabhdha Karma\n3. Agami Karma\n\nThe Man's present existence is mere repetition of his past birth. So whatever the karma he accumulated from the past birth is called Sanchita karma.\nThe finite portion  of Sanchita Karma that will be fructified in the present birth and it is called Prarabdha Karma. \nThe actions that are yet to be completed because of pava and puniya that are created in the present birth is called Agami karma.\n\nThe Sanchita karma is the complete collection of all your Puniya and papa. Of this infinite Sanchita karma the finite portion will be fructified in this birth which is called Prararbdha karma.\nWhen more Puniya is fructified you will see a lot of good luck in your life when more papa is fructified in this birth than you will see a lot of suffering.\nNow you will understand why some people are luckier and some people have more suffering. Again in this birth you may do some puniya you may also do some papa. This collection of \nPuniya and papa in the present birth will either add to your Sanchita karma or maybe fructified in the present birth itself. This portion of karma that is accumulated in the present\nbirth is called Agami. \n\nNow let us see how karma is related to astrology.\n\nProfessor B. Suryanarain Rao beautifully tells the relationship between karma and astrology as follows \n\"Before the birth of a child It has some karma to its credit and as a result of that karma it takes birth in a particular family with particular surrounding, special physical features and noticeable mental\ninclinations. This karma of the infant which is resulted in its birth and surrounding is called Sanchita Karma or that which is already stored in.\nSo your horoscope is very unique according to your own past Sanchita karma and astrology is a beautiful tool to understand the consequences of your past karma.\"\n\nLearning astrology and reading horoscope will help you to understand the consequences of your past karma so that you can alter your results with Agami karma.\n", "doc_id": "d96ca76a-2985-4cef-af2a-10704fbe37f2", "embedding": null, "extra_info": null, "index": 0, "child_indices": [], "ref_doc_id": "9c05dd84-a8eb-42be-99ff-a6f2dfa7db1b", "node_info": {"start": 0, "end": 3318}}, {"text": "60 vighatis make one Ghati and 60 Ghatis make one day.\nIn Vedic period 60 Ghatis make one day and in the modern method 24 hours make one day.
