This is caused by the cyclic precession of the earth\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s axis in its rotation.  \n\nThe Earth has a wobbling motion and one wobbling cycle of Earth approximately takes 26000 years. This wobbling effect of Earth creates precession of equinox. Spin top is the best example to understand the Earth's wobble effect. \n\nThe Earth has bulge at the centre and the Earth will have a more gravitational pull from both sun and moon in this middle area. \n\nAnd because of more gravitational pull at the centre of the Earth, there is a shift of axis in the north and south pole is called wobble effect\n\nThe intersection of ecliptic plane and celestial equator is called vernal equinox. This vernal equinox is moving one degree for every 72 years due Earth's wobble effect.\n\nIn one AD the North Pole is pointing towards the sign Pisces and the north pole star is Polaris.The pole star is changing for every 2000 years and this cycle completes in twenty six thousand years.\n\nIf you look up the night sky and observe north celestial pole, the north pole star will shift for every 2000 years. For example in 2000 AD, the north pole star is Polaris.\n\nNow let us understand the significance of wobble motion in the astrological calculations.The Vernal equinox point is moving due to Earth's wobble motion.\n\nThe difference between the first point Aries and Vernal Equinox is called Ayanamsa. It is believed that around 400 AD the first point of Aries and Vernal equinox were coinciding. Hence during 400 AD the Ayanamsa is Zero.\n\nWhen you cast a Western horoscope and reduce Ayanamsa, you will get Vedic horoscope.\n\n", "doc_id": "2c488298-bea2-4392-a699-40f2be2252f3", "embedding": null, "extra_info": null, "index": 0, "child_indices": [], "ref_doc_id": "3e0bee39-992a-42aa-be29-340bfa8b6135", "node_info": {"start": 0, "end": 1878}}], "__type__": "list"}}}}
