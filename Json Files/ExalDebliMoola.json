When the planet rule a particular sign then that sign is called own house of that planet.\n\nThe following are the rulership of each zodiac signs\n1. The sign Aries is ruled by Mars\n2. The sign Taurus is ruled by Venus\n3. The sign Gemini is ruled by Mercury\n4. The sign Cancer is ruled by Moon\n5. The sign Leo is ruled by Sun\n6. The sign Virgo is ruled by Mercury\n7. The sign Libra is ruled by Venus\n8. The sign Scorpio is ruled by Mars\n9. The sign Sagittarius is ruled by Jupiter\n10. The sign Capricorn is ruled by Saturn\n11. The sign Aquarius is ruled by Saturn\n12. The sign Pisces is ruled by Saturn\n\nThe following are the planetary ownership in each house\n1. Mars rules the sign Aries(Mesha)\n2. Venus rules the sign Taurus(Vrishabha)\n3. Mercury rules the sign Gemini(Mithuna)\n4. Moon rules the sign Cancer(Kataka)\n5. Sun rules the sign Leo(Simha)\n6. Mercury rules the sign Virgo(Kanya)\n7.

Saturn rules the sign Aquarius(Kumbha)\n12. Jupiter rules the sign Pisces(Pisces)\n\nHere is the easy way to remember the planetary ownership of each zodiac signs. The Sun and Moon rules only one sign each. Sun rules Leo and Moon rules Cancer.\nThe sign Gemini and Virgo are ruled by Mercury. The sign Taurus and Libra are ruled by Venus. The sign Aries and Scorpio are ruled by Mars. The sign Pisces and Sagittarius are ruled by Jupiter. \nThe sign Aquarius and Capricorn are ruled by Saturn. \n\nNow, I am going to explain the Exaltation, debilitation and Moolatrikona signs for each planet here.\n\nThe exaltation literally means the planets when occupies these signs gets high dignity. \n\nLets go over exaltation signs. \n1. The Sun gets exalted in the sign Aries and Sun gets deep exaltation at 10 degree of Aries.\n2. The Moon gets exalted in the sign Taurus and exactly at 3 degrees it is in the deep exaltation.\n3. Mercury gets exaltation in the sign Virgo and mercury gets deep exaltation at 15th degree.\n4. Mars gets exalted in the sign Capricorn. At 28th degrees Mars gets deep exaltation\n5. Jupiter gets exaltation in the sign of cancer and at 5 degrees Jupiter gets deep exaltation\n6. Saturn gets exalted on the sign Libra and at 20 degree Saturn gets deep exaltation\n7. Venus gets exalted on the sign Pisces and at 27th degree Venus gets deep exaltation.\n\nThe Debilitation means weakness, so when Planet occupy these signs then it becomes weak. Here is the easy way to remember the debilitation sign. The debilitation sign is very easy to remember if you are aware of the exaltation signs the debilitation sign of a planet will be exactly 180 degree from its exaltation point for all the zodiac signs diagonally opposite side is 180 degree. \nFor example for the Aries the Libra is 180 degree and for Taurus Scorpio is 180 degree and for Gemini Sagittarius is 180 degree and for cancer the Capricorn is 180 degree and for Leo Aquarius is 180 degree so on and so forth.\n\nThe following are debilitation sign for each planets\n1. Sun gets debilitated in the sign Libra at 10 degrees  \n2. Moon gets debilitated in 3 degrees Scorpio\n3. Mercury gets debilitated in 15 degrees Pisces\n4. Venus gets debilitated at 27 degrees Virgo \n5. Mars get debilitated in the sign Cancer at 28 degrees\n6. Jupiter gets debilitated at 5 degrees Capricorn \n7. Saturn gets debilitated at 20 degree Aries\n\nAnother easy way to remember the debilitation signs of each planets is, the signs in which Sun gets exalted that the Saturn will get debilitated. Similarly, the sign in which Saturn gets exalted that the sun will get debilitated\nThe sign in which Mercury gets exalted Venus will get debilitated. The sign in which Venus gets exalted that the mercury will become debilitated the sign in which Mars gets exalted. The Mars will be debilitated in the sign in which Jupiter gets exalted and Mars will be debilitated in the sign where Jupiter gets exalted and finally the moon alone will get debilitated in Scorpio.\n\nThe Moolatrikona sign is again the benefic sign, When the planet occupies Moolatrikona signs its dignity is again high. Hence a planet in the Moolatrikona is capable of producing good results. \n\nThe following are Moolatrikona sign for each planets\n1. Sun gets Moolatrikona in the sign Leo between 0 to 20 degrees\n2. Moon gets Moolatrikona in the Sign Taurus within 4 to 20 degrees\n3. Mercury gets Moolatrikona on the sign Virgo between 16 to 20 degrees\n4. Venus gets Moolatrikona in the sign Libra between 0 to 15 degrees\n5. Mars gets Moolatrikona in the sign Aries is between 0 to 12 degrees\n6. Jupiter gets Moolatrikona in the sign Sagittarius between zero to 10 degrees\n7. Saturn gets Moolatrikona in the sign Aquarius between 0 to 20 degrees\n\nA quick thumb rule to remember Moolatrikona house for all planets except Mercury and moon the Moolatrikona house will be own sign of the planet. For example the sun gets Moolatrikona in the sign Leo\nwhich is its own house. The Venus gets Moolatrikona in the sign Libra which is its own house. Mars gets Moolatrikona in the sign Aries which is its own house and Jupiter gets Moolatrikona in the sign\nSagittarius which is its own house and Saturn gets Moolatrikona the sign Aquarius which is its own house and for the moon The Moolatrikona house will be exalted house. \nFor Mercury Moolatrikona house is both exalted and own house. \n", "doc_id": "8b4ce069-f7e7-4867-874a-285349a6224b", "embedding": null, "extra_info": null, "index": 0, "child_indices": [], "ref_doc_id": "68b7b2e2-0506-46c9-a652-50274bc179f6", "node_info": {"start": 0, "end": 5519}}], "__type__": "list"}}}}
