The Moon illuminates light from the sun and when Earth comes between the Sun and the Moon the Earth's shadow completely covers the Moon thus creating lunar\n\neclipse. \n\nWhen the Moon comes between the Earth and the Sun, it will block the light of Sun coming to the Earth and thus creating Solar Eclipse. \n\nYou may think Moon is relatively smaller than the Sun but how can completely cover the sunlight come into the earth. But interestingly if you take the distance between the Earth and Moon as one, the distance between the Earth\n\nand Sun is 400 times more and the size of the sun is also 400 times greater than the moon. And because of this reason when viewed from the earth both Moon and Sun looks to be of same size. This is why during Solar Eclipse Moon is able to completely block the Sun light.\n\nWhy eclipse is not occurring for every 15 days? The moon's orbit around the Earth and the Earth's orbit around the Sun are tilted approximately 5 degrees. When the Moon orbits the Earth in the same ecliptic plane of that of Sun then ideally we would have eclipse for every 15 days\n\nBecause of the difference between the ecliptic plane(Earth's path around the Sun) and Moon's orbit, the eclipse is possible only when Earth, Sun, and Moon are aligned in the line of nodes. \n\nIf you draw an imaginary lines along the line of nodes, the north node is called Rahu and the South node is called Ketu. \n\nSince Rahu & Ketu are always in the line of nodes, Rahu and Ketu play a vital role in the formation of Eclipse.\n\nYou can easily find the eclipse date and time by casting a vedic chart. In a vedic chart, when Sun, Moon, Rahu and Ketu aligns in the same line of nodes the eclipse will occur.
