An Aspection and can happen during two scenarios\n1. A planet can aspect an another planet\n2. A planet can aspect an house.\n\nThe aspection is always count from the first to sign of the planet that is involved. There are single and mutual Aspection exist between the planets.\nFor example a planet A aspect the planet B but where as the planet B doesn't Aspect planet A. This is called single aspection.\nIn an another scenario, the planet A is aspecting Planet B and Planet B is also Aspecting Planet A and this is called mutual Aspection.", "doc_id": "2af7723b-9b4d-4245-a4df-b04397349886", "embedding": null, "extra_info": null, "index": 0, "child_indices": [], "ref_doc_id": "99615d65-aaa7-4d4e-976a-3803c2a9bf3f", "node_info": {"start": 0, "end": 962}}], "__type__": "list"}}}}
