Planets on account of certain positions in the heaven gets certain source of strength and weakness.\nSimilarly, Bhavas(houses) on account of being occupied or aspected by certain planets will acquire certain source of strength and weakness, \nthis calculation of strength of planets and Bhavas is purely astronomical. Usually this value of strength of Bhavas and planets will be in the mathematical Number.\nThis mathematical value will be immensely helpful while making predictions of the horoscopes.\n\nThe planetary strength is collectively called the Shadbala. The shad literally means six and balas literally means strength. So the Shadbala is \nis the six source of planetary strength.\n\nLet us go over each strength.\n1. The first one is Sthanabala, Sthana means position. The Sthanabala is the positional strength of the planet due to the planet occupying certain positions in the horoscope. \nThe Sthanabala is the cumulative of Ochchabala, Saptavargaja bala, Ojayngmarasyamsa bala, kendrabala and drekkanabala.\n\n2.The second is Digbala. Dig literally means direction. The digbala is the calculation of strength according to the planetary directions in the horoscope.\nThe Jupiter and mercury Gets highest Digbala when occupies ascendant(East). The Moon and Venus gets maximum dig bala when occupies fourth house(South).\nThe Saturn gets the highest Digbala in the seventh house(West). The sun and mars gets the highest digbala in the tenth house(North).\n\n3. The third is Chestabala. The Chesta literally means motion and Bala indicate strength. Chesta Bala is acquired by a planet due to motion. Especially retrograde motion\nMars, Mercury, Jupiter, Saturn and Venus gets Chestabala during retrograde motion or in conjunction with full moon.\n\n4. The fourth is Kalabala. The Kala means time and bala means strength. The Kalabala is calculated by considering the year, month, date, and time of the birth. Since that time is continually\nchanging this Kalabala is also the refered as temporal strength. The Kalabala is cumulative of Nathonnatha bala, Paksha bala, Thribhaga bala, Varsadhipa bala, Masa bala, Vara bala, Hora bala,\nAyana bala, and Yuddha bala. \n\n5. the fifth is Drikbala. Drik Literally means Aspection or drishti. The Drikbala of a planet is acquired by Aspection and hence it is called as Aspectional strength.\nThe general thump rule for drikbala is when the planet gets benefic aspection it will get full drikbala, whereas if the planet gets malefic aspection from other planet then\nit'll take away the strength.\n\n6. The sixth is Naisargikabala which literally means permanent strength. The kalabala which we discussed before a while is a temporal strength \nWhereas the Naisargikabala is the permanent strength. So irrespective of the horoscope, The Naisargikabala Of planet is always the same. Naisargikabala bala is mentioned in shastiamsas.\n1. Naisargikabala of Sun is 60 Shastiamsas.\n2. Naisargikabala of Moon is 51.43 Shastiamsas.\n3. Naisargikabala of Venus is 42.85 Shastiamsas.\n4. Naisargikabala of Jupiter is 34.28 Shastiamsas.\n5. Naisargikabala of Mercury is 25.70 Shastiamsas.\n6. Naisargikabala of Mars is 17.14 Shastiamsas.\n7. Naisargikabala of Saturn is 8.57 Shastiamsas.\n\nThe Residential strength is acquired by the planet according to the it Occupancy in the Bhava. A planet that is in the middle of the bhava\nWill have more residential strength whereas the planet in the bhava sandhis will have less residential Strength.\n\nThe next is Bhavabala, The Bhaba literally means house and bala is strength. Bhava Bala is the strength of house of signification. \nbhavabala is cumulative of Bhavadhi  bala, Bhava dig bala, and Bahava drishti bala. When a bhava gets more\nstrength in the horoscope than the results pertaining to that Bhava will be more pronounces whereas if a Bhava bala in a particular horoscope is weak\nthen the results pertaining to that Bhava will be less pronounced.\n\nThe next is Ishta bala and Kashta bala. The Ishta means good and Kashta means bad. So, Ishta and Kashta bala of a planet will be useful to access to good and\nbad results of planet in the dasa period with respect to the Bhava. For example in a horoscope if Jupiter occupies seventh house and gets more Ishta bala\nthen in Jupiter dasa or bukti the native will see more good results related to marriage, business partnership, and travel.
