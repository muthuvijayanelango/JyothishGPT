Rahu, Ketu and Eclipse are discussed here. 
The Rahu & Ketu are the 2 nodes that are taken into account in the Vedic system whereas Rahu & Ketu are excluded in the Western astrology.
Rahu and Ketu are very important phenomenon for Eclipse to occur. 

Let us understand how eclipse occurs. The Moon illuminates light from the sun and when Earth comes between the Sun and the Moon the Earth's shadow completely covers the Moon thus creating lunar
eclipse. When the Moon comes between the Earth and the Sun, it will block the light of Sun coming to the Earth and thus creating Solar Eclipse. 
You may think Moon is relatively smaller than the Sun but how would Moon completely cover the sunlight coming to the earth. But interestingly if you take the distance between the Earth and Moon as one, the distance between the Earth
one and Sun is 400 times distant from the Earth. Also, the size of the sun is also 400 times greater than the moon. Because of this reason when viewed from the earth both Moon and Sun looks to be of same size. This is why during Solar Eclipse Moon is able to completely block the Sun light.
Why eclipse is not occurring for every 15 days, during full moon or new moon day? The moon's orbit around the Earth and the Earth's orbit around the Sun are tilted approximately 5 degrees. When the Moon orbits the Earth in the same ecliptic plane of that of Sun then ideally we would have eclipse for every 15 days
Because of the difference between the ecliptic plane(Earth's path around the Sun) and Moon's orbit, the eclipse is possible only when Earth, Sun, and Moon are aligned in the line of nodes. 
If you draw an imaginary lines along the line of nodes, the north node is called Rahu and the South node is called Ketu. 
Since Rahu & Ketu are always in the line of nodes, Rahu and Ketu play a vital role in the formation of Eclipse.
You can easily find the eclipse date and time by casting a vedic chart. In a vedic chart, when Sun, Moon, Rahu and Ketu aligns in the same line of nodes the eclipse will occur.
