Ayanamsa, Precession of Equinox, Vernal equinox are discussed here. 
Vedic astrology take into account of Precession of Equinox whereas the Western astrology don't include the Precession of Equinox in the calculations.
Precession of the equinoxes means the motion caused by the equinoxes along the ecliptic, that is on the plane of the earth’s orbit. This is caused by the cyclic precession of the earth’s axis in its rotation.  
The Earth has a wobbling motion and one wobbling cycle of Earth approximately takes 26000 years. This wobbling effect of Earth creates precession of equinox. Spin top is the best example to understand the Earth's wobble effect. 
The Earth has bulge at the centre and the Earth will have a more gravitational pull from both sun and moon in this middle area. 
And because of more gravitational pull at the centre of the Earth, there is a shift of axis in the north and south pole is called wobble effect.
The intersection of ecliptic plane and celestial equator is called vernal equinox. This vernal equinox is moving one degree for every 72 years due Earth's wobble effect.
In one AD the North Pole is pointing towards the sign Pisces and the north pole star is Polaris.The pole star is changing for every 2000 years and this cycle completes in twenty six thousand years.
If you look up the night sky and observe north celestial pole, the north pole star will shift for every 2000 years. For example in 2000 AD, the north pole star is Polaris.

Now let us understand the significance of wobble motion in the astrological calculations.The Vernal equinox point is moving due to Earth's wobble motion.
The difference between the first point Aries and Vernal Equinox is called Ayanamsa. It is believed that around 400 AD the first point of Aries and Vernal equinox were coinciding. Hence during 400 AD the Ayanamsa is Zero.
When you cast a Western horoscope and reduce Ayanamsa, you will get Vedic horoscope.
