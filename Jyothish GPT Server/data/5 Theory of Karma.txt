Theory of Karma is discussed here. 
Theory of Karma is an important topic in the astrology. In fact karma and astrology are interrelated and Without understanding karma one cannot understand and appreciate astrology.
Karma is the best proof to show disparities in human life. Let us get a little deeper into the theory of karma. The universe is operating in a certain harmony. When harmony is disturbed nature will always try to restore its lost harmony.
For example when the pendulums is at equilibrium state there will not be any motion. When we perform an action of pulling one pendulum back then the harmony is disturbed.
Now, this first pendulum will create an in-equilibrium in all other pendulums. This in-equilibrium will continue until all the pendulums come back to an equilibrium state. 
In a similar way The Karma neither rewards nor punishes. It only restores its lost harmony.
Karma is commonly referred to the cycle of cause and effect but it is not as simple as this pendulum example where the last harmony will be restored quickly.
The karma is a circular cause and effect. The Karma is neither good nor bad. The Karma is also not an instant reward system but the karma is just the result of Pava(bad deeds) and Puniya(good deeds).
The man will suffer or rejoice based on his past acts. 

Let us see three types of Karma,
1. Sanchita Karma
2. Prarabhdha Karma
3. Agami Karma

The Man's present existence is mere repetition of his past birth. So whatever the karma he accumulated from the past birth is called Sanchita karma.
The finite portion  of Sanchita Karma that will be fructified in the present birth and it is called Prarabdha Karma. 
The actions that are yet to be completed because of pava and puniya that are created in the present birth is called Agami karma.

The Sanchita karma is the complete collection of all your Puniya and papa. Of this infinite Sanchita karma the finite portion will be fructified in this birth which is called Prararbdha karma.
When more Puniya is fructified you will see a lot of good luck in your life when more papa is fructified in this birth than you will see a lot of suffering.
Now you will understand why some people are luckier and some people have more suffering. Again in this birth you may do some puniya you may also do some papa. This collection of 
Puniya and papa in the present birth will either add to your Sanchita karma or maybe fructified in the present birth itself. This portion of karma that is accumulated in the present
birth is called Agami. 

Now let us see how karma is related to astrology.

Professor B. Suryanarain Rao beautifully tells the relationship between karma and astrology as follows 
"Before the birth of a child It has some karma to its credit and as a result of that karma it takes birth in a particular family with particular surrounding, special physical features and noticeable mental
inclinations. This karma of the infant which is resulted in its birth and surrounding is called Sanchita Karma or that which is already stored in.
So your horoscope is very unique according to your own past Sanchita karma and astrology is a beautiful tool to understand the consequences of your past karma."

Learning astrology and reading horoscope will help you to understand the consequences of your past karma so that you can alter your results with Agami karma.
