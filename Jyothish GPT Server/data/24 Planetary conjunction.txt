Planetary conjunction and planetary aspection are discussed here. 
When two or more planets are conjoined in the same zodiac sign it is called as planetary conjunction. 
The result of the conjunction depends on the nature of the planets involved and also depends
on the zodiac sign in which the conjunction occurs. When the longitude of two planets are within 10 degrees then we can call these two planets are in conjunction.

A planet getting view from the other planets is called aspection. An Aspection and can happen during two scenarios
1. A planet can aspect an another planet
2. A planet can aspect a house.

The aspection is always count from the first to sign of the planet that is involved. There are single and mutual Aspection exist between the planets.
For example a planet A aspect the planet B but where as the planet B doesn't Aspect planet A. This is called single aspection.
In an another scenario, the planet A is aspecting Planet B and Planet B is also Aspecting Planet A and this is called mutual Aspection.
