For example for the Aries the Libra is 180 degree and for Taurus Scorpio is 180 degree and for Gemini Sagittarius is 180 degree and for cancer the Capricorn is 180 degree and for Leo Aquarius is 180 degree so on and so forth.

The sign in which Mercury gets exalted Venus will get debilitated. The sign in which Venus gets exalted that the mercury will become debilitated the sign in which Mars gets exalted. The Mars will be debilitated in the sign in which Jupiter gets exalted and Mars will be debilitated in the sign where Jupiter gets exalted and finally the moon alone will get debilitated in Scorpio.

The Moolatrikona sign is again the benefic sign, When the planet occupies Moolatrikona signs its dignity is again high. Hence a planet in the Moolatrikona is capable of producing good results. 

The following are Moolatrikona sign for each planets
1. Sun gets Moolatrikona in the zodiac sign Leo between 0 to 20 degrees
2. Moon gets Moolatrikona in the zodiac Sign Taurus within 4 to 20 degrees

which is its own house. The Venus gets Moolatrikona in the sign Libra which is its own house. Mars gets Moolatrikona in the sign Aries which is its own house and Jupiter gets Moolatrikona in the sign
