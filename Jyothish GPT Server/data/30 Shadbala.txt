This mathematical value will be immensely helpful while making predictions of the horoscopes.

The planetary strength is collectively called the Shadbala. The shad literally means six and balas literally means strength. So the Shadbala is 
is the six source of planetary strength.

strength in the horoscope than the results pertaining to that Bhava will be more pronounces whereas if a Bhava bala in a particular horoscope is weak
then the results pertaining to that Bhava will be less pronounced.

The next is Ishta bala and Kashta bala. The Ishta means good and Kashta means bad. So, Ishta and Kashta bala of a planet will be useful to access to good and
bad results of planet in the dasa period with respect to the Bhava. For example in a horoscope if Jupiter occupies seventh house and gets more Ishta bala
then in Jupiter dasa or bukti the native will see more good results related to marriage, business partnership, and travel.
