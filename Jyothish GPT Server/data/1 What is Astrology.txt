what is vedic astrology? In simple term, the Vedic astrology is the study of influence planets and stars on human affairs. Taking the right guidance using Vedic astrology will help you get the success in life. 
Let us go little deeper. Let me take you to the origin so that you will not only understand what is vedic astrology but you will
also understand what is the purpose of vedic astrology. Do you agree with me that life has a lot of uncertainty? nobody of you or me can possibly tell what is going
to happen tomorrow or even what is going to happen one year from now. so during uncertain situations the ignorance lead to confusion whereas the knowledge lead to betterment.
Vedic Indians seers developed something called VEDAS which is nothing but the best practices. If you understand and follow those best practices in your life then you can very well reduce the uncertainties
in your life.

The VEDAS are divided into four vertical pillars called Rig Veda, Yajur Veda, Atharva Veda and Sama Veda. The vedas are again divided into six
Horizontal sections called Vedhangas(otherwise called Limbs of VEDA). 
The six Vedhangas are shiksha, Chandas, Vyarkana, Nirkutha, Kalpa and Jyothisha and each one of the division is aimed at giving clarity
on different aspects. 
The shiksha focuses on the phonetics, the Chandas focuses on the poetic meters, the Vyarkana focuses on the grammar, the Nirkutha focuses on etymology, the Kalpa focuses on the rituals and
Jyotisha focuses on the auspicious timings. Of all these six Vedhagas the Jyothisha has been given the highest importance and Jyothisha is often referred as Eye of Veda. 
Vedic astrology is like a modern day G.P.S of life. So when we use the right astrological guidance then taking the right decision at the right time will be very easy.
