Bhava and Lagna(Ascendant) are discussed here
Bhavas and houses are often used interchangeably.
The Bhava in Sanskrit TRANSLATED TO ENGLISH simply means state or condition and hence the Bhava is nothing but the state of the zodiac signs and planets and other heavenly bodies viewed from the earth during birth of the child.
The ascendant is first Bhava and the subsequent bhavas are counted in the clockwise direction in the South Indian vedic chart. 
The First Bhava is called Ascendant and the Seventh Bhava is called Descendant. The Ascendant is rising and the Descendant is the setting. 
The Ascendant(First Bhava) is also called as Udaya Lagna which is in the East of the observer
The Descendant(seventh Bhava) is also called as the Astha lagna which is in the West of the observer
The Tenth the Bhava is called as Madya Lagna which is in the North of the observer
The Fourth Bhava is is called as Patala Lagna and it is in the South(below the ground) of the observer
