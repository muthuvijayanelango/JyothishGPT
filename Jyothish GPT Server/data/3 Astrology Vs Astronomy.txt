Astronomy and astrology relationship, Surya Siddhanta, Rishis are discussed here.
In fact for an astrologer the basic level of astronomy knowledge is very important to make accurate predictions. 
If you rewind back history most of the prominent astronomers were also had belief and knowledge in astrology. For example, Isaac Newton who introduced the gravitational force to the modern world, Kepler
who developed the law of planetary motion and Galileo who found the satellites of Jupiter and Saturn rings and all of them had a knowledge in astrology.
The Surya Siddhanta, one of the oldest book on astronomy known to mankind has been written in India and contributed by many of the Indian astronomers like Varahamihra, Bhaskaracharya.
Sage Varahamihra is known for this wonderful work on Brihat Samhita which talks about planetary motions and its influences on countries. The Bhaskaracharya is also a prominent Indian astronomer and in fact he noted gravitational
force well before Newton in his treasure Surya Siddhanta. 

Let me quickly take you through the commonalities and differences between astrology and astronomy.
1. The astronomy is the study of celestial objects such as planets, moons, and stars whereas the astrology is the study of planetary influence on human life. 
2.The astronomy is more of observational study and it is primarily focused on studying origin and the evolution of human mankind whereas the astrology is a predictive and guiding tool to mankind 
3. Before 1400 AD astronomy and astrology were studied together but after 1400 to 1700 AD astronomy gained interest among many researchers and because of that the astronomy became part of science whereas the astrology remained
mystics science till today.

The Surya Siddhanta, the oldest text of astronomy was written between 500 to 600 A.D. This timeline is approximate because there are several studies still going out to find when exactly the Surya Siddhanta has been written. 
The Vedic period is believed to between 1200 to 1500 BCE. The modern astronomy evolved after 400 AD. People like Bhaskara, Aryabhata, Kepler. Galileo and Newton are contributed heavily to the astronomy.
The vedic astrology is primarily contributed by 18 Rishis of which Vashista, Bhrigu, Garga, Parashara, Varahamihra, Jaimini, Satyacharya are notable Rishis.
